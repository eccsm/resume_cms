# Resume Creator
## Resume Creator with Angular

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

This project was developed with Angular and Express to create people their own resumes themselves.

Some of the points are missing like API-based tokens and content of resume stay flexible.

Express writes and reads data on/from JSON files.

JSON File formatted like a 2D array to read data easily.

You can change data storing with DB and use your own APIs.
